    <h2>The Mission</h2>
        <p>We aim to help small businesses by leveraging technology to create astetically appealing, and intuitive ways for various people to interact with their product online, for an affordable rate.
           
           
           
            It is my understanding that a great product is the major key for success in a business. 
            It is also my belief that this may be one of many keys to unlock one of many level of success.
                I believe that in the same way location, astetics, and customer interaction play a major role in the success of a business operating with a brick and motar location,
                    The way a customer interacts with your online presence, is just as crucial.
                
            We work service people who have a great product, by creating ways for users to interact with that product in a way that matches the greatness of that product.
                this includes but not limited to: 

                    digital store fronts
                    visually appealing emails
                    fresh and relative ad campaigns
                    social media management

            We believe, although a web presence is just as critical as the presence of a brick and motar location
                The convience of operating in this way is the fraction of the cost it affords 
                    with that our services create a virtual infrastructer at a fraction of the cost of a brick and motar
            
            We believe that our services should cost 10% of the realized gross revenue that will be directly impacted by our service.
                If we can help you create 100k in revenue within a fiscal year.. our services should not exceed 10k for that project
                If we can generate 1m in revenue within a fiscal year, we aim to provide you with 100k in value to ensure we realize every ounce of potential our combined efforts can provide.
        </p>

        <h2>Services</h2>
        
        <h3>custom email development</h3>
        <p>
            In doing some research I learned that the leading email development service offers 
                $10-$20/month (with irrelevant ads) 
                    to interact with 500 existing and potential customers and contacts
                $300+ to interact 10,000

                and tops out at around $600 every month.
            
            I'm not sure about the size of your business now and in the future but what this means is
                
                You still have to create every single email, form, or landing page with the limited templates the provide
                If not you'll have to hire someone to do it for you which is more on top of that

                We provide an alternative... work with us and we handle all of that for you for less
                unlimited scaleability, customization, and application

                for $200/month we provide

                    Custom emails for any and every scenario
                        Basic response, update, and informative emails in plain text have a scammy feel to them and often get overlooked
                        I find that customized emails instantly build trust, attract attention, and further develop good repor with your customers
                        and emails that aren't developed in a synergistic way often get overlooked or classified as irrelevant..
                         
                            We help your business with emails that work with ever email environment

                    Intergrated Forms & Single Page Websites that will intergrate with your exsisting infrastructer and help guide the contact to the right place
                        So if your contact interacts with your email they will have something appealing and intuitive to further develop their initial interest
                    

                    Around the clock support
                        Consider us a part of the team... We will work with your designers and developers for a seamless experience
                        and if you don't have any, well we can easily fill that gap with creative and technical assistance however neccessary at no extra cost to you.
