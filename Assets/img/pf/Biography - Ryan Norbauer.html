        <span class="details">
            I’ve worked for NASA, planned and conducted my own research 
at the CDC, and served as a
            foreign affairs analyst/speechwriter in the British 
Parliament; I founded, ran, and sold
            two separate software companies and one apparel company, and
 I have published peer-reviewed
            scholarship in leading journals across two separate academic
 disciplines. Other than the
            occasional unpredictable infusion of cash, lots of stress, 
and the ability to impress
            status-conscious morons with the preceding sentence, all 
that early-life ambition and hard work got
            me very little. I now spend my days focusing on 
creatively-satisfying industrial-design projects, creating high-end 
products for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl8LsdIDJ41">nationally-known brands</a> and selling geeky luxury goods through my own "<a href="https://shop.norbauer.com/">nerd atelier</a>", Norbauer &amp; Co.

            claiming to be "offended" is just a lazy way to tell another person to shut up

            a global web software consulting firm, acquired by another 
firm in 2008. We
            were a team of over twenty software architects, engineers,

capacity as CEO, I was cited in <em>Wired</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, and 
many other venues. We built bespoke server software for clients ranging 
from Yale University, Microsoft, Harvard, and AMD to a wide variety of 
tech start-ups and international businesses.

            The first major online community for gay men to challenge 
the tired tropes of gay culture, providing a more aesthetically 
palatable (and less vapid)
            alternative to the various "scenes" that previously existed 
for gay men to meet and form friendships—or fall in love. Founded in 
2004, our
            offices moved to Manhattan in 2005 when we obtained investor
 funding. During that time, we won laudatory national press from outlets
            like <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i>, <i>TechCrunch</i>, and the <i>Boston Globe</i>. In 2010, Lovetastic was acquired by <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/">OKCupid</a> (now Match.com).

            everything is fairly easy. Most of what passes for intelligence is just persistence and a high tolerance for boredom
            (both of which may technically be the same thing).
