# Welcome to my personal learning center!

This is where I will host everything I've learned thus far, as a capstone monolith.
## FIRST --> HTML/CSS/SASS

I've found that there are several components that make up any given webpage, and while each one of them separtely sound fairly simple to create, I've found that utilizing them all to create a decent web application is slightly more challenging. What I've done here is set out to create all of them individually, with enough repition to be able to create any one of them within minutes. Once I feel as though I truly understand the fundamental make up of the web component, I then move on to the next.
##The Components
{ Button, Checkbox, ComboBox, ContentBox, Date, DialogBox, Dropdown, Form, Gallery, Grid, Icon, Image, Menu, Modal, Navbar, Popup, Progress, Radio, Slider, Spinner, Table, Tabs, Tag, Text, Toggle, Tooltip }

## THEN --> TEMPLATES/DESIGN SYSTEMS/COMPONENTS

Once I've completed making each component I will then take what I've learned and create systems, modules, and components that will help me speed up my work flow. This is the phase where I create type systems, animation libraries, content management systems, and default layouts that I can either reference or impliment to improve the overall pace and productivity of my workflow.
## The Systems
{ Type & Font, Transition & Animations, Asset Library, Grid & Layout, Components & SubComponents }


## FINALLY --> BRING IT ALL TOGETHER WITH JAVASCRIPT
Now that I have a base understanding of fundamental web components, code architecure, and design systems, I will aim for incorporating Javascript in the same way. By doing so I hope to create applications and tools that myself and others can actually use on a daily basis. These will serve as capstone projects that effectively serve as real world projects to make up for lack of experience. These projects are very challenging and ambitious in my honest opion, but give me a chance to develope my skillset in a brutally honest way. Some of the capstone projects will be started intermitantly between the HTML/CSS portion of the project, allowing me to properly track my progress, then I will polish and refactor them further as I move along to more advanced techniques.
## The capstone projects
{ SVGLIB/IMAGE GALLERY/FONTLIB , KAKEIBO, TASKMAN/TODO, WIKI/BLOG.forEach }


## IN CONCLUSION --> TLDR

I've noticed that every time I feel like I have what it takes to build something from scratch, I find myself taking hours to do simple tasks in both Javascript and CSS. After hours of painstaking work that would result in lackluster, and sometimes incomplete work, I would give up feeling deflated. This process has helped me realize the utility in frameworks and libraries, but also why fundamental concepts are so important. More importantly I realized that failure to properly utilize such concepts would probably create a recurring pattern of drudginly muddling through projects with no clear understanding of how or why it all works. This motivated me to apply what I'm learning in a practical way, building things that can help me write code more effectively while saving time on future projects in the same light.
