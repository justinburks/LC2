10 things I learned as a cook
    (that doesn't involve cooking)
    Things take time, then more time
        -patience + persistence
        -when to stick & when to split
        -compound success
    All the skill that business requires
        (
            building fundamental skills (outside of your specialty)
                -sys admin
                -web design
                -photography
                -writing
                -graphic design
                -software engineering
                -networking
                -marketing
                -hiring (being dangerous at everything first)
        )
    Why money really makes the world go round
        (cooks/chefs don't make much money, so to start/run a business as a cook/chef takes alot of DIY upfront)
        (
            time = money
            speed wins 
            money = less time spent on basic task & more time spent on your specialty )
