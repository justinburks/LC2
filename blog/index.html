    <h1>14 Days of CSS</h1>
        <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>For this simple mission my goal is to intentionally hone my html/css skills before moving on to 
                intermediate/advanced javascript techniques. I am exploring the possibilities of css by creating 
                and recreating several ui elements without javascript. The mission is simple, in 100hours spread over 14days
                I aim to focus on the following with a minimum of 5 different applications and 3 different styles for each, 
                then document the entire thing and make use of my knowledge by creating a fully functional blog to segway into 
                the javascript/php/node portion of my journey.
                <h2>The Elements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">buttons</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">checkboxes</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">comboboxes</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">content box</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">date picker</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">dialog box</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">dropdown</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">forms</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">gallery</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">grid layouts</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">icon</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">menu</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">modal</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">navbar</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">pop-up</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">progress</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">radios</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">sliders</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">spinners</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">tabs</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">tags</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">toggle</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">tooltip</a></li>
                </ul>
                <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
                <p>
                    If someone asks me to create one of these at a moments notice, I aim to be so comfortable with the
                    process that it takes me 15mins or less for any single component.
                    <h3>start</h3>
                    <p>1/20/2022</p>
                    <h3>deadline</h3>
                    <p>2/3/22</p>
                    <h3>daily time alloted</h3>
                    <p>7-8hrs</p>
                </p>
            </p>

            <p>
                This has quickly turned into a semanticUI clone and for all intents and purposes I plan to incorporate Implimentations of several if not all 
                Material UI components

                This project feels very long winded, and sometimes unneccesary but by going through each fundamental element listed on the semantic library,
                creating a simple clone with basic styles and functionality and then redesigning them as a re-usable web component I feel like I am learning at 
                a very deep level. I am purposefully avoiding abstract designs and functionality until completion of this project because I feel as though those
                things may be easier and less time consuming to create if I understand the fundamentals of each UI element.

                I'm learning that every webpage as complex as some may seem, boil down to a handful of visual components, the complexity comes in as a matter of
                circumstance when you must define how these visual components behave according to the users needs.

                Thats when javascript comes in. However in my experience trying to learn and/or implement complex javascript features without a base foundational
                knowledge of the visual components that represent them or the backend methods that make them possible feels like trying to eat a sandwhich with no bread...
                In other words, it's possible but things can get messy very easily.

                And so, I feel like the rather long process of this project is very neccesarily redundant method for building the fundamental knowledge base required for
                optimal web & software development, and the best repsonse to the overwhelming notion of "You shouldn't learn this until you understand that, and you won't understand
                that if you don't know this." often leading people to ask "So where do I start? How long should it take"
                
                I'm not sure if its the best way to learn, however it is a method I've abstracted from learning other skills in the past, such as photography, writing, and cooking.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first iteration of this project may seem very messy and unprofessional however this is rather intentional, being that I have successfully created a minimum
                viable product so to speak for this segment of my learning development.
                Next is where we do it again... but faster and cleaner with more features and functionality. Then, AND ONLY THEN, do we pickup and run with javascript and it's many
                libraries.
