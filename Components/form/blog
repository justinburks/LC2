Description

In this micro-component module I've set out to lay the foundational understanding of a form really is with only html and css involved

In doings so I may better javascript may influence and control the intergration of such components in various use cases.

By reducing commonly used components down to its simplest use case I hope to abstract much of the comonalities into webcomponents that are easy to create and maintain.
