I chose this project as a capstone to test my skills for practicality. For one I personaly love svgs and they way they
can bring granular control over animations, positioning and filesize. I find myself reaching for them frequently and while they are my favorite type of icon to use, the process of finding and organize them felt very cumbersome.

For example if I wanted to use a particular icon in a current project, I would have to either search for it over the world wide web, download, and intergrate, or search for it within the sticky web of files in my local machine. For one svg, this didn't take a considerable amount of time however, if I wanted several of them for a different purpose, but all matching the same general style guide, thats when the process starts to feel obstructive in terms of productivity and workflow.

Initially I set out to solve this problem with a dedicated website that I would get all of them from.... I went with The Noun Project, and although this helped streamline the system/process, creatively it didn't feel like the silver bullet and I started to sense that no one library was. In realizing this I started searching for Icon packs, both free and paid, ending up with around 10,000 svgs to choose from. Now I could be sure that for most situations I had the right icon/set for the job without ever having to connect to the internet... This led to another problem... I didn't know of a way to view the svg file format cleanly and quickly, and even if I did... the process of organizing, clicking through in a guess and check way, and then copy/pasting/importing the desired icon felt like I would be adding gasoline to a grease fire. 

Solution:: Leading up to the project I knew a couple things. I knew that I had massive collection of svgs/images/and pngs on my machine, I had some knowledge of how to build applications, and I wanted to learn how to build useful production applications relatively quickly so I thought, why not make one... Why not make an application that I could build to host,view,update, and import into any project at a moments notice... like a widget? like a desktop/web app? Maybe at the end of this project I can comfortably say that I devoloped/engineered some sort of productivy software. I was all in just the thought of potentialy building real software had me drooling at the mouth.

STEP 1:: ORGANIZING THE FILES
Enter the shell --> BASH,AWK,SED,GREP
/$ REGEXP ?/ --> JS strings -> NATIVE Text Editing
OPEN API --> JSON.parse
JAVASCRIPT LAND --> MVC + OBSERVABLES
PRETTIER --> FRONT-END DESIGN & ARCHITECTURE
DEPLOY --> NODE & FRIENDS
