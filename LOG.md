Basic Model & Architecture finish, now basic module styles must start, then bring it together to finish main features for a MVP before moving on.
--> comeback and update as you learn

Figuring out a coherent style to suite the application seems a bit more challenging than writing the actual javascript for some reason... Trying to 
strike a balance between modern & functional without making it look too playful. I want things to standout but they come out too playful.
Maybe the answer is in the simple things like z-index,box-shadows,color contrast, and font choices.

Also it seems like the more I get into it the ideas for features come faster than the pace I'm actually equiped to develop.. So I guess I'll mind map them here

# MIND MAPS
**MAKE A DOWNLOAD BUTTON THAT UPDATES AN EXTERNAL API... MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE A NPM PACKAGE. SO THAT I CAN IMPORT COLLECTIONS WITH A FEW LINES OF CODE

**INSTEAD OF DOWNLOAD BUTTON, USE AN IMPORT BUTTON, THAT HAS AN OPTION TO CREATE A CSS MODULE, VIA NODEJS, THAT HAS THE SELECTED STYLES AND ANIMATIONS ATTATCHED TO IT, OR WRITE SPIT OUT A WEBCOMPONENT AS A FILE

In learning about higher order functions like filter/map/reduce, higher - higher order functions like transducers/trampolines/and composers, its safe to say that my brain is fried. I initially created classes in what I believed to be a MVC pattern, these methods returned other methods and so on to do several tasks and called them all in succession with a single function, I now know that I was on the right track however what I was doing was in the spirit of functional programming but was not at all that. It was imperative, hard to pick back up and keep building on. It also gave me the feeling that if I wasn't careful i could've turned to spagetti at any point and I felt there was a way to compose/pipe and abstract all of these methods and eventually create a declarative interface. Well this 9 hour course. This 9 hour course is proving that but I need time to process all of this information. I still plan to write css modules so that when I do start hacking away at the javascript again, it will begin to look feel and behave like an application with real potential for production, and more importantly, an application tbuilt on foundational concepts that can be applied to different applications looking for a similar result.
